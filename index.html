I am a keener in applied mathematics, and I have also developed interested in computer science. I hope to bridge the two disciplines in order to drive software applications that are mostly based on data-driven decisions. I always enjoy the idea of independtly taking on data science projects from start to finish.

My work involves the implemention of improved predictive models in radio signal waveform dectection. I also worked at Environment Canada as a co-op student where I was involved with research and predictive modelling of air quality data.

		        <p>I developed two visualization applications as part of the final project of CPSC 547: Information Visualization. As random forest belongs to a class of black-box models for machine learning, the purpose of the visualizations is to provide intuition and descriptive information for the set of trees generated by a random forest classifier.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            Fitting a linear regression to a set of data can be easily carried out with R or Python. It is almost routine to just import the data and run a simple function such as lm in R. However, if the data is in the size of terabytes, forget about R as we cannot even import the data using a standard laptop of 8 Gb of memory. The solution is to use Hadoop and map-reduce which provide a way to process big data very efficiently. This presentation provides an introduction to Hadoop and map-reduce, and a guide to running a pseudo-distributed environment as well as on a cluster in AWS. 

            Compiled from a combination of notes from online classes, blogs, tutorials, ... etc.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
